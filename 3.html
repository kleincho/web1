  <h2>Crime and Punishment-Dostoevsky</h2>
<p>It was a bright day in <strong>April</strong>,<br>
and the clocks were striking <u>thirteen.</u>
</p><p style="margin-top:45px;">
o the church to pray.
Because I was happy upon the heath,
And smild among the winters snow,
They clothed me in the clothes of death,
  </p><p><img src="performance.jpg" width="30%">
  </p><p>And taught me to sing the notes of woe.
And because I am happy and dance and sing,
They think they have done me no injury,
And are gone to praise <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIujyMzyOEE"

God</a> and his Priest and King,
Who make up a heaven of our misery.</p>
