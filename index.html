is a broad genre of popular music that originated as "rock and roll"
in the United States in the early 1950s, and developed into a range of different
styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom.
It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, a style which drew heavily from
the genres of blues, rhythm and blues, and from country music. Rock music also drew
strongly from a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated
influences from jazz, classical and other musical styles. Musically, rock has centered
on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric bass, drums, and
one or more singers. Usually, rock is song-based music with a 4/4 time signature using
a verseâ€“chorus form, but the genre has become extremely diverse. Like pop music, lyrics
often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are
frequently social or political.</p>
