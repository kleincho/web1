  <h2>Great Expectations-Charles Dickens</h2>
<p>It was a bright day in <strong>April</strong>,<br>
and the clocks were striking <u>thirteen.</u>
</p><p style="margin-top:45px;">
A little black thing among the snow,
Crying weep! weep! in notes of woe!
Where are thy father and mother? say?
  </p><p><img src="performance.jpg" width="30%">
  </p><p>And taught me to sing the notes of woe.
And because I am happy and dance and sing,
They think they have done me no injury,
And are gone to praise <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIujyMzyOEE"

God</a> and his Priest and King,
Who make up a heaven of our misery.</p>
